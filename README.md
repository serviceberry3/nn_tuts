So far I've written nn_test.py, which models a slow, naive, yet easy-to-follow implemenation of a neural network feed-forward function.

I've also used Keras to visualize what convolutional layers look like in neural networks, and I've done a toy example of gradient descent to see how the algorithm works.

This stuff is based on a short mini-book I read called "An introduction to neural networks for beginners" by Dr. Andy Thomas. I HIGHLY recommend it. You'll know exactly how your NN code works, what's going on in backpropogation, etc. after just 40 pages!
